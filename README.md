## Introduction
Farkle Game - Medieval Tavern Edition is a digital adaptation of the classic dice game Farkle, inspired by the medieval world of *Kingdom Come: Deliverance*...

## Why I Built This
I wanted to create a portfolio project that showcases my skills in React, game development, and UI/UX design...

## Project Scope
The goal of this project is to build a fully functional Farkle game with the following features...

## Features
### Implemented
- Basic dice rolling and display...

### Planned
#### Rogue-Like Progression
To make the game more engaging and replayable, I’ll add rogue-like mechanics where players face increasingly difficult opponents, earn money, and unlock upgrades. Here’s how it works:

### **Core Features**
- **Opponents**: Face unique opponents with increasing difficulty (e.g., Drunkard, Merchant, Knight).
- **Money**: Earn money by defeating opponents. Use it to buy upgrades in the shop.
- **Shop**: Spend money on:
  - **Dice Upgrades**: Better dice with higher chances of rolling good numbers.
  - **Badges**: Permanent buffs (e.g., start with extra points, re-roll dice).
  - **Drinks**: Temporary buffs for the next match (e.g., re-roll dice, double points).
- **Progression**: Unlock new opponents and upgrades as you progress.
- **Losing**: If you lose, you get kicked out of the tavern and start over (but keep permanent badges).

### **Example Upgrades**
- **Lucky Dice**: Higher chance of rolling 1s and 5s.
- **Gambler's Charm**: Start each round with 1200 points.
- **Tavern Ale**: Re-roll one dice per turn.

### **Game Flow**
1. Start in the tavern with basic dice.
2. Choose an opponent to challenge.
3. Win to earn money and unlock upgrades, or lose and start over.
4. Use the shop to prepare for harder opponents.

## Progress So Far
- Set up the React app and folder structure...

## Future Ideas
- Add multiplayer functionality using WebSockets...

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Framer Motion...

## How to Run the Project
