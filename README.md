## Introduction
Farkle Game - Medieval Tavern Edition is a digital adaptation of the classic dice game Farkle, inspired by the medieval world of *Kingdom Come: Deliverance*. This project combines game logic, animations, and a medieval-themed UI to create an immersive single-player experience with an AI opponent.

---

## Why I Built This
I wanted to create a portfolio project that showcases my skills in React, game development, and UI/UX design. Farkle is a fun and challenging game, and adding a medieval tavern theme allows me to explore creative design and animations. This project also helps me practice state management, game logic, and integrating sound and animations into a web app.

---

## Features
### Implemented
- Basic dice rolling and display.
- Scoring rules for single dice and combinations.
- Player and AI turn mechanics.
- Medieval-themed UI with a tavern background.
- "Score," "Score and Continue," and "Skip Turn" buttons.
- Dynamic dice pool that updates after scoring.

### Planned
- Smooth dice rolling animations.
- Sound effects for dice rolls and game interactions.
- AI opponent with varying difficulty levels.
- Victory screen and game-over animations.
- Rogue-like progression with money, badges, and drinks.

---

## Progress So Far
- Set up the React app and folder structure.
- Implemented core game logic for dice rolling and scoring.
- Created a basic UI with a medieval tavern theme.
- Added player and AI turn mechanics.
- Implemented "Score," "Score and Continue," and "Skip Turn" buttons.
